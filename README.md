# DicePass
A simple [Diceware password](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) generator for Windows (32 and 64-bit).

*Note:* Passwords are generated pseudo-randomly. It is not wise to use this tool for super secret things.

## Usage
1. Make sure there's a `wordlist.asc` file in the same directory as the program.
2. Run the program. It will use the `wordlist.asc` file. 

## Word lists
Releases include the alternate wordlist, but it can be swapped out for any of the other wordlists:

* [Diceware list](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc)
* [Alternative list](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/beale.wordlist.asc)
* [Non-English word lists](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html#japanese)

**Ensure that the word list is properly named `wordlist.asc` in the directory.**
